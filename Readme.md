# ProxyMe


.NET dynamic proxy library.

ProxyMe can create three different types of proxies.


## Proxy

A proxy is a reference to an interface.


## Contract

A contract is a class that implements an interface.

Only properties may exist on the interface.

Properties use backing fields to store values.


## SubType

A sub type is a class that inherits from another class.
